# Digest-downloader
It downloads digest in PDF format from UUnovels website.

I made it using GIMINI.
Steps:
1. Make sure you have an IDE (Pycharm or VS code)
2. clone my git
3. Make a venv and Install dependencies 
4. Go to the UUnovel website and go to the page where reader mode is avaialble (with next button and page number at bottom). i.e. https://thisaccessories.com/reading-base/?cat=201&paged=1#gsc.tab=0

5. Copy the first page link (will be required when running)
6. Go to terminal in your ide and run the novel_downloader.py
7. Enter your URL and see it start working (takes about 30-40 minute)
